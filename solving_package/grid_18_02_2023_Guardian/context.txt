This Guardian 13x13 Quick Crosswords Grid produced no valid solutions in an acceptable duration nor using acceptable space.
This is mainly due to computer constraints as well as Python's run speed.
If anyone wants to go ahead and run it, I have not put on github the results from each step of the solving process, but I still have them.
The process was still kept running for demonstration purpose.

The focus has now switched to smaller, 5x5, MiniNYT-type grids.
